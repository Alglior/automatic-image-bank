# Image Bank Project

This project is an image management system that processes, categorizes, and displays images based on their metadata. It includes features for extracting image metadata, organizing images into categories, and providing a web interface for browsing and searching the image collection.

## Features

- Metadata extraction from images using ExifTool
- Automatic categorization of images based on metadata
- Web interface for browsing and searching images
- Pagination for efficient navigation through large image collections
- Individual image view with download option
- Category view for exploring images by tags

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- ExifTool installed on your system
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Alglior/automatic-image-bank
   cd automatic-image-bank
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install ExifTool:
   - For MacOS (using Homebrew):
     ```
     brew install exiftool
     ```
   - For Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
     ```
   - For Windows:
     Download from the official website: https://exiftool.org/
     Add the ExifTool directory to your system PATH.

## Usage

1. Prepare your images:
   Place your images in the `input_images` folder.

2. Process the images:
   Run the main script to process and categorize the images:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   This will process the images in the `input_images` folder and organize them in the `output_folder`.

3. Initialize the image bank:
   Run the extraction script to create the image bank database:
   ```
   python extract.py
   ```
   This will create an `image_bank.json` file with the image metadata and categories.

4. Start the web server:
   Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python images_bank_server.py
   ```
   The server will start, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. Access the web interface:
   Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to browse and search your image collection.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Processes images and extracts metadata
- `extract.py`: Initializes the image bank database
- `images_bank_server.py`: Flask server for the web interface
- `caption_florence2.py`: Script for generating image captions (not directly used in the main workflow)
- `input_images/`: Directory for input images
- `output_folder/`: Directory for processed and categorized images
- `captions.json`: JSON file containing image captions
